## Week 1: Introduction to Data Science

In the first week, you'll receive a comprehensive introduction to the field of data science. This includes an overview of the data science process, the tools and technologies used, and a dive into the Python programming language.

**Day 1:** You'll start by understanding the course's structure and setting your expectations and goals. You'll then learn what data science is and gain insights into the data science process.

**Day 2:** This day covers an overview of the tools and technologies commonly used in data science. You'll explore different programming languages like Python and R, databases (SQL and NoSQL), data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, PowerBI), and machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).

**Day 3:** Get familiar with the Python programming language, its history, features, and advantages. You'll also make comparisons with other programming languages.

**Day 4:** Dive into basic programming concepts in Python, including variables, data types (numeric, string, boolean, etc.), operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc.), control structures (if-else, for loop, while loop, etc.), and functions.

**Day 5:** Introduction to Jupyter Notebook – learn how to set it up, run basic code, use Markdown and LaTeX for documentation, and save and share your Jupyter Notebooks.

## Week 2: Data Exploration and Visualization

The second week focuses on data exploration and visualization, essential skills for understanding and communicating insights from data.

**Day 1:** Introduction to the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. Learn about data structures like Series and DataFrame.

**Day 2:** Dig deeper into Pandas – reading and manipulating data from various sources (CSV, Excel, JSON), exploring data using methods like `head`, `tail`, and `shape`, selecting and filtering data, handling missing values, and performing grouping and aggregation.

**Day 3:** Explore basic data exploration and visualization techniques using Matplotlib. Learn to describe data (mean, median, mode), create histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

**Day 4:** Introduction to the Seaborn library for advanced data visualization. Install and set up Seaborn, compare it with Matplotlib, and create various plots such as `distplot`, `countplot`, and `violinplot`.

**Day 5:** Dive deeper into Seaborn – learn about pair plots, facet plots, heatmaps, and joint plots for more advanced visualization techniques.

## Week 3: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

Data preprocessing is crucial for preparing your data for analysis. This week covers techniques like handling missing data, outliers, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

**Day 1:** Understand the importance of data preprocessing and different types of techniques used. Recognize how data preprocessing impacts the quality of your analysis.

**Day 2:** Learn about missing data – what it is, strategies for handling it, and techniques for imputing missing data in Python.

**Day 3:** Dive into outlier detection and treatment – understand what outliers are, strategies for dealing with them, and techniques to identify outliers using Python.

**Day 4:** Explore feature scaling techniques – understand why feature scaling is important, learn about different scaling techniques, and implement them in Python.

**Day 5:** Focus on data cleaning and preparation – discover techniques for cleaning and preparing your data for analysis using Python.
